2. File should be optimized according to the specification:
   - Convert to WOFF2 format as primary delivery format
   - Create WOFF and TTF fallbacks
   - Implement dynamic subsetting for latin and latin-ext character sets
   - Configure proper cache headers and CORS settings
3. Font should be referenced in the application's font face declarations
4. Ensure proper licensing compliance for SF Pro font usage
